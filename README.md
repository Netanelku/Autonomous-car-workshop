Welcome to the Smart Retrieval Autonomous Car Project

Our team is excited to introduce our latest endeavor: the development of a Smart Retrieval Autonomous Car. 

This cutting-edge vehicle is engineered for swift item retrieval within designated areas, integrating advanced features such as wireless WiFi remote control and a mobile camera for visual identification. 

Our primary objective is to create an adaptable autonomous car capable of identifying and retrieving items autonomously, guided by remote visual commands. By streamlining the retrieval process, our innovative solution offers a reliable and efficient method for locating and recovering specific items.
